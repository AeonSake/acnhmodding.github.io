## Replacement Mods

A replacement mod, as the name suggests, is a mod that simply replaces an existing model in the game. It's the most used method in **Animal-Crossing: New Horizons** community, as it's the easiest way to develop and use a mod.

These mods can change the aesthetics of the game without affecting the core gameplay.


| Pros | Cons |
-------|-------
| Easy to Create | Can't add new items |
| Can be used online | May not be compatible with all mods |

## Additive Mods

An additive mod is a mod that adds new content to the game, such as new furniture, clothing, items or even new mechanics. These mods are more complex to create and require a deeper understanding of the game file types.

## How to Create a Mod
To create a mod, first you will need to extract the files from your game. You can do this by following our [Dumping RomFS Guide](../../guides/dumping-romfs).
