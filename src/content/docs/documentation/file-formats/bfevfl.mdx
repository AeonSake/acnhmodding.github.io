BFEVFL (Binary Format for EVent FLows) is a file format used by Nintendo in multiple games to handle certain in-game events and mechanics.

## What is a Event Flow?
An Event Flow is a sequence of events that can be triggered in the game, such as dialogues, cutscenes, or other scripted actions. These flows are defined in BFEVFL files and can include various parameters and conditions for execution.

### How to Edit
**BFEVFL** files can be edited using tools like [Zelda's Event Flow Editor](https://github.com/zeldamods/event-editor) or [ACNH EventFlow Decompiler](https://github.com/asteriation/acnh-eventflow-decompiler)

:::caution
Zelda's EventFlow Editor is designed for BOTW, some ACNH files may not be compatible with it.\
It's recommended to use the ACNH EventFlow Decompiler and Compiler for Animal Crossing: New Horizons specific files.
