## Types of Mods
In **Animal-Crossing: New Horizons** there are two main types of mods, **Replacement Mods** and **Additive Mods**. Each type has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of which type to use depends on the modder's goals and the desired outcome of the mod.

### Replacement Mods
A Replacement Mod, as the name suggests, is a mod that simply replaces an existing model in the game. It's the most used method in the community, as it's the easiest to develop and use.

These mods can change the aesthetics of the game without having to handle complex files such as [BCSV](/documentation/file-formats/bcsv) or **MSBT**. They are also more 'stable' and easier to use, as they do not require (*in most cases*) a mod manager to be installed.

### Additive Mods
A Additive Mod adds new content to the game such as: *furniture*, *clothing*, *items* or *even new mechanics*, but are in general more complex to create and require a deeper understanding of the game file types.

They are also more prone to conflicts with other *additive* mods, as they change files that other mods can also be using. 

## Comparison of Mods
When choosing between Replacement Mods and Additive Mods, it's important to consider the pros and cons of each type. Below is a comparison table that highlights the key differences between the two types of mods.
