## Installing MSBT Editor
**[MSBT Editor](/tools/msbt-editor)** is the primary tool used to edit MSBT files.

<Steps>
1. [Download the latest version of MSBT Editor](https://gitlab.com/AeonSake/msbt-editor/-/releases/permalink/latest) and [ACNH.mfm](https://gitlab.com/AeonSake/msbt-editor/-/blob/master/maps/ACNH.mfm) (both are updated frequently, so always check for updates!)
2. Extract the zip file and open `MsbtEditor.exe` for the first time. It will generate the folder where you gonna put your `ACNH.mfm` file. 
3. Put `ACNH.mfm` inside the folder called `maps` (inside the .exe folder) - **Don't need to close the editor!**
4. In **MSBT Editor**, locate the `Data` drop-down menu (at the very top) and click on `Change Function Map`, it will pop-up a menu asking a *function map to choose*, select `ACNH` (you can click reload if it doesn't show in the options).
5. Your editor should be ready to use!
