This tutorial will cover how to dump assets from **Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp**.

## Requirements

Before you can start, make sure you have all this requirements:

- An Android System that can run **Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp**.
    - You will need to access your files, so you _may_ need a rooted Android or emulator
- A computer that can run these applications\:
    - [AssetStudioModCLI](#install-assetstudiomodcli) – used to dump **Unity** assets.
    - [Python](<https://www.python.org/downloads/>) – this is needed to run our custom Python script.

Now that you have everything, you can proceed to [Dumping](#dumping)
:::note
You need to complete the **in-game tutorial** so it download all the game assets!
:::

### Install AssetStudioModCLI
<Steps>
1. Navigate to [AssetStudio GitHub](https://github.com/aelurum/AssetStudio/releases/latest)
2. Scroll down and find the right download depending on your System (make sure to download AssetStudioMod**CLI** and **not** the **AssetStudioModGUI**)
3. Extract it to wherever you want
</Steps>

## Dumping
<Steps>

1. In your PC, create a **input** and a **output** folder. It should look like this:
    <FileTree>
    - input/
    - output/
    - \_\_main\_\_.py (<a href="../../downloads/__main__.py" download>download</a>)
    </FileTree>

2. On your Android get your files at `/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.nintendo.zaca` and move the content to the `input` folder in your PC (I'll not cover this cause there is a lot of ways of doing it)

3. Using [python](<https://www.python.org/downloads/>), run the script (You can double-click the file or use `python __main__.py` command)
4. Wait for `Processing complete! Check the output folder.` appear in the console, **do not close the window!**
    > _This can take some time (*1~2 minutes*) but will decrypt every file that needs decryption._
5. Open a terminal in your **AssetStudioModCLI folder** and run this command:
   ```bash
   AssetStudioModCLI.exe "C:\MyStuff\ACPC\output" -o "acpc-assets" -m splitObjects
   ```
   > _Change the path to your output path (created in Step 1)_

6. This command will finally extract all **.fbx** and textures! (in a folder called `acpc-assets`)
</Steps>

:::note
When importing a `.fbx` file in **Blender** it can be VERY small, you can either scale it up manually or append this argument `--fbx-scale-factor 10` (into Step 5) to scale all `.fbx` files.
:::

## Extracting other files
Asset Studio also allows you to dump other file types (video, audio, font, etc); you can use this command to export specific types:
```bash
AssetStudioModCLI.exe "<your-path>" -o "output" -t <types-with-comma>

# Valid -t (type) arguments: tex2d, tex2dArray, sprite, textAsset, monoBehaviour, font, shader, movieTexture, audio, video, mesh
# e.g. AssetStudioModCLI.exe "<your-path>" -o "output" -t mesh,tex2d,audio
```
You can also remove the `-t` argument completely if you want to export **\*everything\***
> Note: `mesh` will export meshes as `.obj` and not `.fbx`;  for fbx files use the default command.
