## What is RomFS?
RomFS is a file system used by the Nintendo Switch to store game data. It contains all the assets, such as textures, models, and sounds, that the game uses. Dumping RomFS allows you to access these files for modding purposes.

## Dump RomFS on Real Hardware
Make sure your Nintendo Switch is modded and has homebrew capabilities before proceeding. Dumping RomFS requires access to the file system, which is not available on unmodded consoles.

<Steps>
1. [Download the latest release](https://github.com/DarkMatterCore/nxdumptool/releases/latest/download/nxdumptool.nro) and copy it to your Nintendo Switch `switch` folder.

2. Download and install [Zadig](https://zadig.akeo.ie/) on your PC. This tool is for USB communication with your Switch.
3. Launch **NXDumpTool** on your Nintendo Switch.
4. Connect your Nintendo Switch to your PC using a USB cable.
5. Run **Zadig** on your PC. Go to `Options` and check the `List all devices` option.
6. In the top dropdown menu, select the `nxdt_rw_poc` USB device.
7. Change the **Driver** dropdown on the right to `libusbK (vX.X.X.X)`.
8. Click on the **Install Driver** and wait for it to finish.
9. [Download nxdt_host.7z](https://github.com/DarkMatterCore/nxdumptool/releases/latest/download/nxdt_host.7z.nro), extract it with 7zip or WinRaR and run `nxdt_host.exe`.
10. Set a output directory by pressing on `Choose` and click on `Start Server`. 
11. In your Switch, on **NXDumpTool**, select `user titles menu`.
12. Find **Animal Crossing: New Horizons** in the list and select it.
13. Select `nca / nca fs dump options` and change the `output storage` to `usb host (PC)`
14. Select `dump base application` (or `dump update` / `dump DLC` if you want to dump those)
15. Select `Program #0: <string of characters>` and then select `FS section #2: RomFS`
16. Click on `start nca fs section dump` and make sure your `nxdt_host.exe` is running on your PC.
17. Wait for the dump to complete. The files will be saved in the output directory you specified in **step 10**.
</Steps>

## Dump RomFS on Emulator
If you are using an emulator like **Yuzu** or **Ryujinx**, you can dump RomFS directly from the emulator without needing a homebrew application.

Emulators like **Sudachi**, **Suyu** can follow the same steps as **Yuzu**. And emulators like **Ryubing** can follow the same steps as **Ryujinx**.

:::caution[Warning]
This guide will not cover how to install or set up Yuzu or Ryujinx.
